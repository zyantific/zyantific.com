A few months ago I wrote a tiny but fine plugin for IDA Pro allowing to theme
everything that cannot be themed using IDA's built-in color-settings. It comes
with a dark theme intended to be combined with the idaConsonance IDA color theme
by default, however custom themes can be created using Qt-stylesheets. You can
find some information about creating themes on the GitHub project page.

## Installation

[The latest pre-compiled version of the plugin can be obtained here](https://github.com/athre0z/ida-skins/releases/latest)

For installation, just drop the contents of the directory matching your IDA
version into your IDA installation root. All versions of IDA starting with 6.0
are supported and should work. If you encounter any problems, feel free to
