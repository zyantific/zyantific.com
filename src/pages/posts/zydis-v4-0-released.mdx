Today we are happy to announce the [release of Zydis v4.0](https://github.com/zyantific/zydis/releases/tag/v4.0.0)!

## Simplified Disassembler API

We introduced new all-in-one functions for decoding and formatting an 
instruction in a single call without the need to initialize a decoder or
formatter up-front. This simplifies using Zydis in cases where performance
isn't of utmost concern and you just want to decode a few instructions on the
quick.

```c
// Decode and format instruction to human-readable assembly in one call.
ZydisDisassembledInstruction insn;
ZydisDisassembleIntel(
    /* machine_mode:    */ ZYDIS_MACHINE_MODE_LONG_64,
    /* runtime_address: */ 0,
    /* buffer:          */ "\x55",
    /* length:          */ 1,
    /* instruction:     */ &insn
);

assert(insn.info.mnemonic == ZYDIS_MNEMONIC_PUSH);
assert(strcmp(insn.text, "push rbp") == 0);
```

For those who prefer AT&T syntax, just swap out `Intel` with `ATT`.

## Encoding Instructions

Zydis now supports encoding instructions, allowing users to generate new code
on the fly or to rewrite existing one with less effort than ever before.

### Generate New Instructions

```c
ZydisEncoderRequest req = 
{
    .machine_mode = ZYDIS_MACHINE_MODE_LONG_64,
    .mnemonic = ZYDIS_MNEMONIC_MOV,
    .operand_count = 2,
    .operands = 
    {
        {
            .type = ZYDIS_OPERAND_TYPE_REGISTER,
            .reg.value = ZYDIS_REGISTER_RAX,
        },
        {
            .type = ZYDIS_OPERAND_TYPE_IMMEDIATE,
            .imm.u = 0x1337,
        }
    }
};

ZyanU8 insn_bytes[ZYDIS_MAX_INSTRUCTION_LENGTH];
ZyanUSize insn_length = sizeof(insn_bytes);
ZydisEncoderEncodeInstruction(&req, insn_bytes, &insn_length);

assert(insn_length == 7);
assert(memcmp(insn_bytes, "\x48\xc7\xc0\x37\x13\x00\x00", 7) == 0);
```

This example code encodes a `mov` instruction from scratch, writing the instruction
bytes into `insn_bytes` and placing the instruction length into `insn_length`.

### Rewriting Code

```c
// mov rcx, qword ptr ds:[0x1234]
ZyanU8 mov_bytes[] = "\x48\x8B\x0C\x25\x34\x12\x00\x00";

// Decode and print the original instruction.
ZydisDisassembledInstruction insn;
ZydisDisassembleIntel(ZYDIS_MACHINE_MODE_LONG_64, 0, mov_bytes, sizeof(mov_bytes), &insn);
assert(strcmp(insn.text, "mov rcx, [0x0000000000001234]") == 0);

// Convert the decoded instruction into an encoder request.
ZydisEncoderRequest req;
ZydisEncoderDecodedInstructionToEncoderRequest(
    &insn.info, insn.operands, insn.info.operand_count, &req);

// Change a few things about it.
req.operands[0].reg.value = ZYDIS_REGISTER_RSI;
req.operands[1].mem.displacement += 0x10000;

// Encode the changed instruction.
ZyanU8 new_insn[ZYDIS_MAX_INSTRUCTION_LENGTH];
ZyanUSize new_insn_length = sizeof(new_insn);
ZydisEncoderEncodeInstruction(&req, new_insn, &new_insn_length);

// Disassemble and print new instruction again.
ZydisDisassembleIntel(ZYDIS_MACHINE_MODE_LONG_64, 0, new_insn, new_insn_length, &insn);
assert(strcmp(insn.text, "mov rsi, [0x0000000000011234]") == 0);
```

This example decodes a `mov` instruction, converts the decoded instruction
into an encoder request, changes the register and displacement values and
then lastly encodes it back to binary code. The final disassembly step is
included merely for demonstration purposes, showing that the instruction
was indeed changed as requested.

## Split Operand Decoding

Zydis allows users to not only inspect explicit operands, but also implicit
ones. Implicit operands are operands that are not printed in the human-readable
assembly generated by the formatter, but are still inspected or changed by the
CPU when the instruction is executed. A prominent example for an instruction
with many implicit operands is `pushad` which essentially pushes all general
purpose registers onto the stack despite having zero explicit operands.

In v3, the `ZydisDecodedInstruction` structure contained a field

```c
ZydisDecodedOperand operands[ZYDIS_MAX_OPERAND_COUNT];
```

where `ZYDIS_MAX_OPERAND_COUNT` was defined as `10`, the worst-case assumption
for the instruction with the maximum number of implicit operands. While this was
convenient, it also caused significant avoidable bloat of the instruction
structure, sometimes causing issues when it was allocated on stack in
environment where stack space is restricted (e.g. kernel threads). Oftentimes,
users were not even interested in the visible operands, only wanting to inspect 
the mnemonic and instruction length in the majority of cases.

In Zydis v4, operand decoding is now optional:

```c
ZyanU8 jmp_bytes[] = "\xE9\xAB\x00\x00\x00";

ZydisDecoder decoder;
ZydisDecoderInit(&decoder, ZYDIS_MACHINE_MODE_LONG_64, ZYDIS_STACK_WIDTH_64);

ZydisDecodedInstruction insn;
ZydisDecoderContext ctx;
ZydisDecoderDecodeInstruction(&decoder, &ctx, jmp_bytes, sizeof(jmp_bytes), &insn);

// Only decode operands if we're actually interested in the mnemonic.
if (insn.mnemonic == ZYDIS_MNEMONIC_JMP) 
{
    // Only decoder visible operands.
    ZydisDecodedOperand operands[ZYDIS_MAX_OPERAND_COUNT_VISIBLE];
    ZydisDecoderDecodeOperands(&decoder, &ctx, &insn, operands, 
        ZYDIS_MAX_OPERAND_COUNT_VISIBLE);
        
    assert(operands[0].imm.value.s == 0xAB);
}
```

For users that are looking for a way to achieve something close to the previous 
behavior, the convenience function `ZydisDecoderDecodeFull` is offered:

```c
ZyanU8 jmp_bytes[] = "\xE9\xAB\x00\x00\x00";

ZydisDecoder decoder;
ZydisDecoderInit(&decoder, ZYDIS_MACHINE_MODE_LONG_64, ZYDIS_STACK_WIDTH_64);

ZydisDecodedInstruction insn;
ZydisDecodedOperand operands[ZYDIS_MAX_OPERAND_COUNT];
ZydisDecoderDecodeFull(&decoder, jmp_bytes, sizeof(jmp_bytes), &insn, operands);

assert(insn.mnemonic == ZYDIS_MNEMONIC_JMP);
assert(operands[0].imm.value.s == 0xAB);
```

## Simplified Formatter API

The formatter API previously had an `Ex` variant of each function whose
only difference was that it had an additional `user_data` argument. This
resulted in unnecessary duplication and bloat of the public interface, so
we decided to just add the `user_data` argument to the regular functions.
Users that don't wish to pass additional context to the formatter can simply
pass `NULL`.

## Amalgamated Builds

We are now publishing amalgamated builds of the library for every version. 
These builds essentially combine all header files into a single `Zydis.h`
and all source files into a single `Zydis.c`, making it very easy to link
against Zydis by just copying it into your project.

Amalgamated builds can also be created manually by running the
`assets/amalgamate.py` script [in the Zydis repository][amalgamate-py].

## Porting Guide

Because `v4` contains a range of breaking changes to the API, we offer a 
[porting guide] explaining the required changes to help making the migration
process less painful.

A huge thanks goes to [Mappa], who contributed pretty much the entire implementation 
of the instruction encoder!
