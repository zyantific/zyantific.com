I recently saw someone asking for a way to apply the .pdb file of a static
library to a binary that is using it. Even if that is probably possible with
some extra effort, there is a better way to achieve the same advantages without
the need to bother with .pdb files: IDA’s FLIRT signature feature (Fast Library
Identification and Recognition Technology). While most IDA users are aware of
the fact that IDA uses to apply some sort of compiler specific signatures to
binaries, a lot of them don’t know that you can generate these signature files
from any static library yourself without too much effort.

To get started, you need to acquire the the FLAIR toolkit from Hex-Rays’
download-page. Extract it wherever you want and spawn a CMD in the newly created
directory, then CD to bin\win. Let’s assume you found out that your target
binary is using MS Detours, however you are unsure of what specific version.
That’s no problem, as FLIRT signatures allow you to generate signatures from
several libraries and compile them into a single .sig file with ease, which also
makes sense in regards of reusability. For the sake of this article, I
downloaded version 1.5 and 2.1 of the express edition of MS detours from the
Microsoft website. You now go on by generating a .pat (pattern) file from each
static library you want to include in the signature file using the pcf tool.
Some .lib files (which are effectively just a package of .obj files) that
contain empty .objs seem to cause some trouble for the pattern generator, which
makes it necessary to provide the -s switch (skip erroneous). After that, you
run sigmake to generate a signature file from the pattern files. For a detailed
description on the arguments of sigmake, take a look into sigmake.txt in the
root of the FLAIR toolkit.

```sh
> pcf -s *.lib
detours15.lib: skipped 0, total 142
detours21.lib: skipped 1, total 145

> sigmake -n"Microsoft Detours" *.pat msdetours.sig
msdetours.sig: modules/leaves: 279/259, COLLISIONS: 1
See the documentation to learn how to resolve collisions.

```

When generating the signature file, the toolkit looks out for colliding
patterns, which need to be resolved by the user manually by opening the
generated .exc in a text editor of your choice. It should look roughly like
this:

```sh
;--------- (delete these lines to allow sigmake to read this file)
; add '+' at the start of a line to select a module
; add '-' if you are not sure about the selection
; do nothing if you want to exclude all modules

?QuadAlign@Detour@@YAKK@Z                           00 0000 83C00783E0F8C3..................................................
?PadToDwordPtr@@YAKK@Z                              00 0000 83C00783E0F8C3..................................................

```

In our example, the list of collisions is short and therefore easy to resolve,
but in cases of huge libraries with >1000 colliding patterns, you are good to go
by just deleting the first marker line, which will causes the generator to drop
all problematic patterns (which usually only makes out a loss of about 1-5% of
your patterns in my experience, which is pretty acceptable compared to hours of
fixing patterns IMHO). Execute the sigmake command from above again and if
everything went right, you should be standing in front of your freshly generated
signature file! You now may apply zipsig on your signature file in order to
compress it, however that’s optional. Finally, copy your .sig file into
sig-directory in the root of IDA’s installation directory. You should now be
able to apply your signature in IDA (CTRL + 1 -> Signatures -> INSERT).

Now, let’s see how well it works when applied to a tiny game cheat I found in
the web: a topic for another article.

As seen above, generating and using signature files can save you a whole lot of
reversing. There are also ways to automatically find library code in projects
using self-compiled libraries, however that’s a bit more complicated and a topic
for another article.
